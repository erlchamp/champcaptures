So finally—after years of having my domain erloumiguel.com sitting under construction on my resume—I now have a real website to show.

From the start, I knew I wanted to build something that would serve as both a portfolio and a personal profile, especially since many companies these days ask for a website when applying for a role.

I figured it was the perfect time to finally do it—especially now that I’ve got a new MacBook Pro (which, by the way, is awesome). I explored a few Hugo themes, and the one that caught my attention was Hugo Plate. One of my main criteria was that the theme had to be actively maintained and come with clear instructions on how to get started.

I’m actually thinking about containerizing the site in the future, but for now, I’m focusing on improving the content and refining the deployment workflow. I’ve set it up with GitHub Actions and Netlify, which has been awesome so far—automated builds triggered on every code merge.

Eventually, I’d love to host this on my own Kubernetes cluster and showcase a full-blown CI/CD pipeline—maybe even integrate some code quality checks, vulnerability scanning, testing, and who knows—maybe even a little Chaos Engineering. I’d love to try that.

But yeah, this is turning out to be a fun project.
