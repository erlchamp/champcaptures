description: "I’m passionate about the “everything as code” mindset—managing not just pipelines and monitoring but also the orchestration of Kubernetes clusters. I build and automate cloud platforms using infrastructure-as-code, so every part of the system is repeatable, scalable, and transparent. My approach combines modern DevOps practices with a focus on platform security and observability, ensuring that environments run smoothly and securely."
